# Comparing LZW vs Huffman Compression
In general, LZA provides better compression than Huffman, because it 

it can archive directories of files (`.tar`) â€”concatenation of multiple files into one file..

Since very long patterns can be built, upp 


In implementing the LZW, we must consider how our
