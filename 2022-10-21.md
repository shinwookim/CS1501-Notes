Matrix: *row* $\times$ *column*
For multiplication, # columns on matrix 1 must match # rows of matrix 2
$(A+B)_{ij}=a_{ij}+b_{ij}$, $(cA)_{ij}=ca_{ij}$, $(AB)_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^n{a_{ik}b_{kj}}$
A matrix is regular iff its pivots are non-zero

Lower-triangular matrices have 0s above the diagonal ($l_{ij}=0,\ i<j$)
Uni-triangular matrices have 1s on the diagonal ($u_{ii}=1$)

Elementary matricies of the first type = $I+$ matrix with a single non-zero lower-triangular entry
From $Ax=b \iff E_3E_2E_1Ax=E_3E_2E_1b$
If we let $U=E_3E_2E_1A$, then $A=LU$, where $L$ is the row operations we did to put A in the row-echelon form (with signs reversed)
$\implies$ **THM.** A regular matrix has an $A=LU$ factorization

Elementary matrices of the second kind swaps two rows of a matrix. They can be undone by doing it again: $EE=I$.

A matrix is **non-singular** if it can be brought to upper-trinagular form with non-zero pivots in the diagonal
+ $Ax=b$ has a unique solution, for every column vector $b$ with the correct size
+ Invertible
+ $Ax=0$ has a unique solution, $x=0$
+ $\det A \neq 0$  
+ $\text{rank}(A)=n$

A permutation matrix is an $n\times n$ matrix such that every row and column has excatly one 1, and the rest are zero.

**THM.** Every permutation is a produict of elementary matricies of the second kind.
+ Permutation matrix can be obtained from $I$ using row interchange

**THM.** If $E$ is an elementary matrix, then $Ax=b \iff EAx = Eb$.
+ For type 1: undo using $L$
+ For type 2: undo using $L=E$

Inverses: $AX=XA=I$
+ Uniqueness
+ $A^{-1}=\frac{1}{ad-bc} \begin{pmatrix}  d & -b \\  -c & a  \end{pmatrix}$
+ For permutation matrix: $P^{-1}=P$
+ $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$
+ $U$ with a non-zero diagonal has an inverse
+ Invertible matricies are products of the three types of elementary matricies

Transpose: $A^T=a_{ji}$
+ $(A^T)^T=A$
+ $(AB)^T=B^TA^T$
+ $I^T=I$
+ $U^T=L$
+ $\verb|Diag|^T=\verb|Diag|$
+ $(A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^T$
+ Symmetry: $A^T=A$
+ If a matrix is symmetric adn regular it can be written as $A=LDL^T$

Rank is the number of no-zero pivots in row echelon form ($r \leq \verb|min|(row number,col number)$)

$Ax=b$ has:
+ zero solution
+ one solution
+ infintely many solution

Determinant:
1. E1 does not change
2. E2 negates 
3. E3 constant multiplication
$$\det A = (-1)^k\det U = (-1)^k\ \Pi diag(U)$$
